# Onboarding - Step 4

Here you define the placeholder texts for your page - the most important are the following you can also see in the screenshot below:

* **{Company}** -&gt; Enter the name of your company here.
* **{Company_Privacy}** -&gt; Enter the link to your privacy policy here.
* **{Company_Location}** -&gt; Enter here the location of your company with zip code and city.

When you have entered the data, click on the green button below. Since the system knows the link to the imprint, it tries to read the necessary data from the page, please correct it if necessary.
