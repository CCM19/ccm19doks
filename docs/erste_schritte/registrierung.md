# First steps

To get started with CCM19 you need either an account from our full service area or a download version.

## Fullservice Version

The registration for the service version is very easy. You choose on the website in the [area "Service-Variante"](https://www.ccm19.de/ccm19-service-tarife.html) the tariff that fits for you and register with your data. Afterwards you will receive an e-mail with the data for the login into the system or you have already entered the data before 

If you already have an account on CCM19, log in to the existing account and navigate back to the service variants overview.

There you can simply book the tariff that suits you and it will be stored in the system. After that you can log in to the CCM19 system by clicking **Login** in the upper right corner of our page. If you use a download version you have to log in where you installed the CCM19.

More information about the login can be found here: [Login](login-and-passwords.md)
