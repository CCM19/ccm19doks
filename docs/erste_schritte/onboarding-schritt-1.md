# Onboarding - Step 1

Directly after the 1st call in the administration you will be guided through the so-called onboarding. In this process, the most important points of your page are queried, scanned and processed. You can take corrective action here at every step.

Everything that is created in the onboarding can be adjusted and changed later in the administration.

If onboarding does not start automatically, you can simply click the following link on the dashboard:

## Enter the domain.

After the first login the following mask appears - here you can enter your domain and scan for cookies and scripts. It is important that you tick off the security note.
