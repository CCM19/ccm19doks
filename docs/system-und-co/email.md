With the button Send test email you can enter an email address there and send a test email to this address. This way you can check if everything works.



## Configuration SMTP send

To be able to send SMTP correctly you have to enter your connection data here. With the button "Autoconfiguration" CCM19 tries to determine the necessary data like server, format etc. by itself.

It is recommended to use this function. Normally only the password has to be entered.
