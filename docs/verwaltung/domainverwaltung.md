# Domain management

You can reach the domain administration by clicking on your name in the upper right corner and then on the item "Domain administration". In the domain administration you can create, edit and delete your domains as well as activate or deactivate the whitelabel function 

You can also see an overview of how many calls are available to you and how many calls have already been used up. Also the number of domains and the number of whitelabel licenses.

You have to be careful with the two buttons. The first one deletes all PageCheck entries all domains, so everything you found in Pagecheck. PageCheck checks your domains regularly for new cookies and other entries.

The 2nd button deletes all inactive domains. These are then irretrievably lost. A backup is not done at this point, so you better be sure what you are doing :-).
