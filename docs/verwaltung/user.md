# User management

In every account from business tariff on, sub-users and sub-groups can be created and managed. You can create and edit users that only have access to your account **and** e.g. only to a domain.

 In the overview you can see the names and dates of each user, last login, when created etc 

The green edit button leads to the edit mask of the respective user, with the red delete button the account can be removed.

### Access rights via groups

The upper fields are self-explanatory, important are the group rights by which the access to the different areas of CCM19 can be used.

### Access to domains

Here you can also define which domain the user is allowed to access.

This way you can e.g. define that certain users may access only one domain, but may only enter imprint and privacy links.
