# Shopify

Shopify is an increasingly popular construction kit for setting up your webshop quickly and easily. Just as easy as the creation of the store is the implementation of our javascript in Shopify.

## Select Dashboard in CCM19

   After the successful installation of CCM19 on your server or setup you will get a javascript code. Copy this to your cache.

## Shopify backend 

Log into the backend of your store. Navigate to the theme settings (1.) and edit your current theme (2.).

Then open the settings using the three dots in the upper left area (1.) and click on "Edit code".

Now we see the files your store consists of. Under Layout is the file "theme.liquid", which you now have to edit (1. &amp; 2.). Insert the javascript from CCM19, which is still in the cache after the element, <head>as seen here in the picture (3.).

## Done

Test in the frontend of your page if the widget appears now. Remember to activate it in the settings of CCM19 before (menu item: Frontend behavior).</head>
