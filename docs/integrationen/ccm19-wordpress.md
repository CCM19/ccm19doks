## Log in to WordPress

To integrate Cookie Manager into a WordPress website, your website must be able to integrate codes or scripts into the head section of all pages and subpages. WordPress has free plugins available for this purpose. Log in to your WordPress site as you are used to.

 

## Select plugin

To install the plugin "Code Snippets", select the menu item "Plugins" on the left side of your WordPress administration and below that the item "install". Now on the right side (Top) enter or search for the keywords "Code Snippets". "Code Snippets" is a free plugin for WordPress, which allows you to integrate any code into your WordPress website. Install/activate the Code Snippet plugin for your website.
