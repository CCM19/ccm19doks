# System Log / Log

In the system log errors, login attempts etc. are logged. So you can see what happened in your CCM19 system during your absence. If nothing special happens, so everything works normally, nothing is logged.

The log data can be evaluated per month by the month selection in the upper right corner. You can navigate through the single pages by using the pagination in the lower right corner.
