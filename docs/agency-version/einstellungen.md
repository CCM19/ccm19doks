These are the default whitelabel links in the footer of your clients' widgets. So you can always have it link to your site from there or hide it completely. This is possible for each of your customers.

**It is about this area

## Link documentation

Here you can also link the documentation to your own installation, so the use of the Github repo really makes sense. This can then be cloned and then realize a separate documentation installation which is then also directly linked to the interface.



Additionally you can hide the help icon if you want. So that it does not link to us if you have no WL documentation.

### Reset to default

The red reset button resets all settings back to default and deletes everything that was changed in there
