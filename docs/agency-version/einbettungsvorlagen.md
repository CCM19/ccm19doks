# Embedding templates

The embedding templates are nothing more than a separate database for cookies / scripts etc. You can set and maintain data here in addition to the data that comes from the CCM19 database.

Here you can also create your own entries that are only available to your customers or in your company, or take existing entries from the CCM19 database and add to them.

## Settings

If you check the box here your customers / clients will additionally be offered the CCM19 database of cookies / embeddings for use. This is also the recommended default state.

In addition, you can also specify here for which **languages** you want to provide these templates.

## Create / edit entry

You can easily take over a new entry from the CCM19 database, just click on the blue button.

From here you can take over an entry directly, it is then available in your database and you can edit the entry there.

The editing is done in the same way as described in the section [Embedding](/functions/cookies-and-others/).
