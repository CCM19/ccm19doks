## Edit texts

You can see a section of the mask in the following screenshot. To (de)activate a language click on the hook "Activate translations". If the hook is active, the language is available in the administration and in the frontend.

You can customize the cookie widget texts, cookie detail page, IFrame blocker and category texts. All elements can be found again in the frontend - you can test here which labels work best.

An even further individualization is possible - but for that you have to get into the source code and programming.
