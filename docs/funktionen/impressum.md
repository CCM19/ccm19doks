# Imprint

According to the GDPR, the imprint of a page - as well as the privacy policy - must be readable by the user before a consent. The visitor may not be forced to make a consent before he has seen this data.

## Imprint as link

You have the possibility to set the link to the imprint directly, for this you have to set the setting in the following mask as follows: "Link imprint".

Then you can enter the link to the imprint directly and it will be used like this in the frontend.

### Show the widget on the page below

If you check this box, the widget will also be displayed on the imprint page. However, this does not make sense in most cases, because according to DSGVO, access to the imprint page must also be possible without a banner.

Therefore, the hook is not set by default **and** you should think carefully whether this should really be used if you want to activate the hook.

### Open in a new tab

If the check mark is set, the links will open in a new window with target="_blank"

## Edit imprint

You can create and edit the imprint directly in the administration, on the following screenshot you can see the edit mask.

## Imprint in frontend

To comply with the DSGVO CCM19 includes the possibility to make the imprint either directly accessible in the widget, as shown in the screenshot or to link it.

The link then opens a mask where the imprint of the page is output - as can be seen here.

## Direct display of the imprint
